Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify unseen images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into their respective classes. To achieve this, a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed and its performance is benchmarked against pre-trained Keras models to validate its effectiveness.
Dataset Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32Ã—32 colored images across 10 classes (6,000 images per class):

Training set: 50,000 images
Test set: 10,000 images
